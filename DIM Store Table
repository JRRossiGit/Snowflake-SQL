-- SQL Script: DIM Store Table logic that omits entries that are not related to the selected ZIPOWNER as well as keep entries relevant based on a rotating panel
-- Version: 2.0
-- Last Updated: 2024-11-21

-- Step 1: Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to filter users based on demographic and statistical criteria
WITH STATIC_CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        ppl.user_id,          -- Unique identifier for users
        stat.factoring,       -- Statistical factoring value for relevant users
        stat.start_date,      -- Start date for the statistics group
        stat.end_date,        -- End date for the statistics group
        bot.zipowner          -- Owner of the ZIP code
    FROM PEOPLE AS ppl
    INNER JOIN STATISTIC_GRP AS stat 
        ON ppl.user_id = stat.user_id
    INNER JOIN DEMOGRAPHICS_BY_ZIP AS bot
        ON ppl.POSTAL_CODE = bot.ZIPCODE
    WHERE bot.ZIPOWNER = 'PLACEHOLDER'   -- Filter for specific ZIP code owner
      AND stat.factoring > 0             -- Include only users with positive factoring values
)

-- Step 2: Retrieve retailer and channel details linked to filtered users
SELECT DISTINCT 
    Basket.BANNER_ID,       -- Unique identifier for retailer banners
    Banner.BANNER,          -- Banner description
    Banner.RETAILER,        -- Retailer name
    Banner.CHANNEL,         -- Channel description
    Banner.PARENT_CHANNEL   -- Parent channel description
FROM STATIC_CTE AS Static
INNER JOIN BASKET AS Basket
    ON Basket.user_id = Static.user_id
INNER JOIN BANNER AS Banner
    ON Banner.banner_id = Basket.banner_id;
